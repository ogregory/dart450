      <p class="narration"> Hello user, it seems that you've forgotten your password. In order to reset that for you we first need to prove that you are in fact a human user through our
        custom CAPTCHA system.
        <br><br>
        Using the tools here, I'll need you to recreate your most recent profile picture, we'll compare the two and assuming all goes well, reset your password.
        Humans are very adept at facial recognition and reconstruction so this should be no problem!
        <br> <br>
        Robots on the other hand? Hoo boy! They have no IDEA what they're doing, creating monster after monster.
        Just a bunch of Frankensteins the lot of them.
        <br> <br>
        When you are satisfied with your facial reconstruction click on the button below to confirm.
