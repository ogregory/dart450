The central drive behind my final project was to explore the concept behind contemporary
CAPTCHA systems and its purpose of convincing machines that you are human.
Along with this I wanted the exploration to be lighthearted and playful, and so
inline with those goals I chose to contextualize the mini ‘CAPTCHA’ challenges in
a D&D-esque fantasy ‘quest’ to recover your lost password.

I wanted the user experience to be exploratory and reflective in terms of interactions
on the web.

In order to accomplish a true sense of exploration and discovery in my challenges
(mostly seen in the password puzzles) I needed to obfuscate the information the user
needed to proceed while still guiding people towards those mini-discoveries. I think
this is best exemplified in the puzzle that requires a user to inspect an element in
their browser in order to view the ID tag of an element, to recover the password and
move on; this kind of functionality is well-known to us in class but aims to not only
teach new functionality to the general public but also be somewhat eye opening for
those who are unaware of the raw, text-based, building blocks of the web that they
interact with and use everyday.

Inline with the D&D-esque aesthetic, I looked for ways to push people to use a
pen and paper to solve some of the puzzles. In providing images of only a piece
of the final passcode after each challenge, it requires users have either very
strong memories or to jot down the information somewhere.

In order to further the sense of ‘exploration’ in the page I made the challenge
 doors appear randomly inside of a div that would be many times larger than the
 users viewport, forcing the user to search the page for a new door/challenge.

I toy with the idea of slow/fast web interactions in two contrasting challenge
pages. The slow page simply asks users to wait a predetermined amount of time,
if the user is too impatient then the link brings them to an incomplete page
and they must return to the previous page and begin waiting again. The fast page
 includes a variably fast moving div that must be clicked on in order to proceed.
 Not only does this remind me of old pop-up banner ads from the earlier days of
 the web, but also found the interaction of a dexterity challenge on the web,
 that bars users from content, interesting and unique.
