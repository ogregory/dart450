Most of my presence and personal interactions online come from my posting my illustrations on various social media accounts (Facebook, tumblr, etc.).
I would say that much of how I define myself online is through these illustrations.
I wanted to find a way to incorporate my illustrations and how they interact with my sense of self.
I was also toying with the idea of how we choose to project ourselves online is very often a process of curation.
We choose which photos of ourselves are uploaded in a particular way that says something about us.

I wanted to create an experience of interactivity with the user that taps into these concepts and themes.
One where they themselves would be able to create their own illustration and tinker with it until they were happy.

In order to implement this I created a simple website where one could interact and change an illustration of my face.
It uses separate divs for each main element of my face (each eye, a nose and mouth) that are interactive,
as well as a static div for my glasses that are set below the rest of the elements (so that it would not interfere with clicking the other elements)
using the z-index property. The images would overlap each other and so all the assets were made as .png files in order to use transparencies.
