  <div id="words">
    It was all a dream I used to read Word Up! magazine
    Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
    Hangin' pictures on my wall
    Every Saturday Rap Attack Mr. Magic Marley Marl
    I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
    Smokin' weed on Bambu sippin' on Private Stock
    Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack
    With the hat to match
    Remember Rappin' Duke Duh-ha duh-ha
    You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
    Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
    Time to get paid blow up like the World Trade
    Born sinner the opposite of a winner
    Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
    Peace to Ron G Brucey B Kid Capri
    Funkmaster Flex Lovebug Starski
    I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
    Call the crib same number same hood
    It's all good
    And if you don't know now you know
  </div>
